This is the MATLAB source codes that solely written by me. 
This part of code contains 3 parts: 
part 1: how to calculate transition matrix through propensity matrix
part 2: how to use SAA nested GA to estimate parameters in the beta distribution (tuned)
part 3: how to do simulation and visualization
