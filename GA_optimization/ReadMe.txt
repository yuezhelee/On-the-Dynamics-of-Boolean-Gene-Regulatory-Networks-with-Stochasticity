Transition.m, Transition2.m are functions calculating transition matrix based on propensities and regulatory rules; 

x_generator.m is generation of left half of table for the regulatory rule; 

simple_fitness_sort.m is definition of fitness function ( difference ) for GA optimization; 

NoDelayGA.m is the optimization function for a defined regulatory network with fixed propensities; 

GA_SAA_MAIN.m is the main function of optimation; this file also gives visual output of pdf from different estimations; 

SendEmailFromMatlab.m is the function notifying user to collect data; PLEASE MAKE SURE THAT CHANGE EMAIL ADDRESS TO USER'S OWN EMAIL ADDRESS; 

1949Jun21.mat: optimization results of nine-gene network
1832Jun22.mat: optimization results of four-gene network
1940Jun22.mat: optimization results of five-gene network

others are figures from it (see data file name and genes)
